# SameGroupsHomeTask
The program reads from a file named "Groups" and finds identical groups.
Identical groups are groups that have the same elements (duplicates are allowed) with no importance of order.
The text file contains group names and their members to the left.
The program prints a set of sets of names of groups that are identical.
A single group in a set means that the group is unique.
